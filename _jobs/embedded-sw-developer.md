As embedded software developer you work on hardware near projects for automotive electronic control units (ECUs). 
You will be part of a cross company team and be responsible from the first idea to the final product.
<br/><br/>
Main tasks are basic software configuration, development and integration of system functions, complex device drivers 
and high level software as well as debugging/testing. The ECUs all follow the Autosar 4 classic or adaptive standard 
and are part of the powertrain, vehicle dynamics or autonomous driving.
<br/><br/>
Almost all tasks can be done from our useblocks office, however 20% of the work can only be done at the customer's site.
<br/><br/>Main skills needed are a high frustration tolerance against software problems and a strong focus 
on embedded systems.
