useblocks has created a [Docs-As-Code](https://www.knowledgeowl.com/home/docs-as-code) 
approach for managing requirements and specifications inside 
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) based documentations.
Key component of this approach is the Sphinx extension 
[Sphinx-Needs](https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for which useblocks is the maintainer.

Several companies and organizations are using this extension worldwide. 
We are searching for a developer, who wants to work with international customers from automotive OEM and TIER-1 
companies and help them to implement new features into 
[Sphinx-Needs](https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Beside this Sphinx-based work, there are additional projects available regarding customer specific tool development.
