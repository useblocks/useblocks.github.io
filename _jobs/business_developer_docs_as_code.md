In the last years, useblocks has created a bunch of Open-Source tools for docs-as-code toolchains. These tools are
getting more and more attention and the docs-as-code approach is starting to be used in engineering departments of
Automotive companies all over the world.

Your job is to take these solutions and make a product and a valuable business out of it.

In the first step, you will be a one-man army, caring about customer contact and sales, product definition and pricing,
and also marketing. 

Over time you use your earned knowledge to define and install internal company processes. based on a growing team under your control.

You are in deep contact with our development teams and discuss and plan upcoming features and releases.

Your decision and plans will be the basement for our commercial success and therefore the reason for a stable and 
ongoing professional contribution to the Open-Source community.
