Review TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 14 v3 (2018)
===========================================

.. _Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3: https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/10-14-Zoll/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-14-matt-Full-HD-IPS-Aluminiumgehaeuse-bis-Intel-Core-i7-Quad-Core-bis-32GB-RAM-bis-zwei-HDD/SSD-bis-12h-Akku-USB-C-Thunderbolt-3.tuxedo

This blog post is in English despite all previous posts being in German. I just assume some international folks might
be interested in this review too. I myself am located in Munich, Germany.

As the title states, I'm going to review the `Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3`_ which from my perspective plays in
the league of a Dell XPS 13/15 or Lenovo T480 when it comes to Linux laptops in the year 2018.
Tuxedo is a German company, based in Königsbrunn near Augsburg. The company mainly offers Linux compatible PCs and
laptops.

The laptop has already gotten some media attention:

Background
----------

I'm a SW developer on Linux platforms since years. My former Laptop was a Lenovo E420s which came into the years
in terms of battery life, CPU performance, RAM size and performance and portability (weight, size).

So I was looking for a new Linux compatible laptop with state-of-the-art hardware.
My wish list items in order of priority were:

1.  **CPU** 8th generation Intel CPU (Core i5 8xxx, Core i7 8xxx)
#.  **RAM** at least 16GB
#.  **Linux** tested compatibility of most relevant components
#.  **Display** ~14 inches
#.  **Weight** <1.8kg
#.  **Build quality** should be reasonable
#.  **Ethernet** RJ45 gigabit without adapter
#.  **Web cam** with a reasonable positioning
#.  **Keyboard** German layout
#.  **Keyboard** backlight available
#.  **Keyboard** typing must be fun (I like hard and short key strokes)
#.  **Quiet** CPU fan / silent without load
#.  **Intel ME** option to disable the Intel ME and generally speaking, I like open hardware

Some notes on above items with the numbers referring to above list:

1.  The 8th generation Intel CPUs (model name Kaby Lake Refresh) for mobile devices feature 4 physical cores.
    With hyperthreading the system has 8 logical cores available. This is a huge benefit when running virtual machines
    and doing CPU intensive stuff in the background.
#.  A laptop with less than 16GB of RAM does not make sense these days.
    Any laptop gets a bonus if RAM can be expanded up to 32GB. I don't buy laptops often
    (the Lenovo E420s is from 2011), so upgradeability is master.
#.  The Linux compatibility is a major problem. It's not easy to find information concerning new laptops if they are not
    offered with a Linux distribution preinstalled by the vendor (like the Dell XPS Developer Edition).
    Thinkpads are also known to work well in Linux environments.

    Another point of interest is the definition of 'Linux compatible'. A laptop contains a lot hardware which may be
    fully compatible, partly compatible or not-at-all compatible. At a minimum, I expect:

    *   Display works with brightness control
    *   Battery life is higher than 5 hours on a recent Linux kernel (4.15 to 4.17) under 'normal' circumstances
        (development, presentation). Problems may arise with CPUs not going into deep idle states or wake-up events
        being continuously fired. This may also involve peripheral.
    *   Touchpad works with multi touch gestures (2-finger scrolling and emulated right/middle mouse buttons clicks).
    *   No restriction to a specific distribution as I will install any distribution I like. Currently I'm on
        Xubuntu (Ubuntu + Xfce) but I want to test Arch + Xfce. The videos of `this <http://unicks.eu>`_ German guy
        convinced me that Arch is the next logical step after running Ubuntu or other Debian based distributions.
        Thanks Nick for your great videos.

        A great source for Linux laptop compatibility is the Arch wiki (in which this Tuxedo laptop is still missing).

    Nice to have are:

    *   Special keys work out of the box
    *   SD card reader
    *   LED indicators

#.  13.3 inch displays are too small for mobile development from my POV and larger displays lack portability.
#.  The weight is relevant although almost all current ultrabooks of 14 inch display size fulfill my constraint.
#.  I like Aluminium not plastic and warp resistant laptop bodies and displays.
#.  Having an real ethernet port without bringing an adapter is just nice.
#.  Many vendors build the web cam below the display or even into the keyboard. This is not a user friendly design
    decision. I use video chat throughout my day and colleagues don't want to look at me through the eyes of a fish...
#.  I like a Germany keyboard layout because I live in Germany. It's not an absolute must because I can use a German
    keymap without having the right symbols printed on the keys but it's a plus if I can get it.
#.  Having a background light for the keyboard is a benefit when working in dark environments like during the night or
    also on low-light environments during the day. My current Lenovo E420s has a small light above the display which
    shines on the keyboard; in dark environment you can barely see anything, so I'd rather go with a background
    illumination.
#.  This is low on my priority list because most of the time I have an external keyboard attached. But SW development
    is a keyboard centric task so a good keyboard is a plus.
#.  When not running CPU intensive tasks, I don't want the CPU fan to run. If the fan runs, I want the noise to be
    'acceptable'.
#.  I use a lot of open source software, I participate in open source development, I like the Free Software Foundation
    and the Linux project in general. Open source has a high relevance for companies too (think of Linux,
    OpenStack or Kubernetes). Unfortunately, there are no vendors on the market that feature open hardware. The whole
    industry of current desktop computing is build around Intel, AMD or SoCs that have no open specification. That's a
    pity. If I'm going for current hardware, I cannot follow the hardware proposals of the FSF and choose 5 years old
    hardware. Then I could also stick with my old Lenovo.
    Having the option to run Coreboot and remove/deactivate the Intel ME and AMD PSP would really be a huge benefit
    for me.

    There are companies like `Purism <https://puri.sm>`_ or `system76 <https://system76.com>`_ that intend to deactivate
    the Intel ME on current CPUs. They do a good job but reverse engineering takes times, so there's no option for
    the latest hardware.
    I'd love to live in a world of open hardware, open firmware and companies that will fail when bringing non-open
    hardware to the market. But the truth is, I need an affordable and current product to run the applications I like.

    At the end, there is no product on the market that fulfills the priority items on my wish list, so I had to move
    this point to the end :(

I am not particularly interested in USB-C, Thunderbolt or docking stations. However, if these work with the model of my
choice I'm happy too. Also USB-C charging is nice to have. As I don't have any USB-C hardware or chargers already, I
need a new charger anyway.

Candidates
----------

I chose between the following models

*   `Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition <https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-linux>`_

    **Pros**

    *   good Linux support
    *   latest hardware
    *   Germany keyboard layout
    *   build quality

    **Cons**

    *   13.3 inch display is too small
    *   price tag

*   `Thinkpad T480 <https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/ThinkPad-T480/p/22TP2TT4800>`_

    **Pros**

    *   basically good Linux support
    *   latest hardware
    *   build quality
    *   Germany keyboard layout

    **Cons**

    *   the finger print sensor won't work currently but I think the reverse engineered driver might be available soon
        for T480: https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90
    *   price tag (in my configuration above 1.800€ brutto)
    *   I don't like the switched Strg/Ctrl and Fn keys on my E420S and the T480 has the same layout. When switching
        between external keyboards and the laptop keyboard I always got confused.

*   `Huawei X Pro <https://consumer.huawei.com/us/tablets/matebook-x-pro/>`_

    **Pros**

    *   latest hardware

    **Cons**

    *   at the time of my decision not yet available in Germany
    *   bad web cam positioning (built into keyboard)
    *   price tag

*   `Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3`_

    Tuxedo commonly buys its parts from the Taiwan company `Clevo <http://www.clevo.com.tw>`_.
    The base of this laptop seems to be the Clevo N141WU.

    **Pros**

    *   latest hardware (RAM up to 32GB)
    *   Germany keyboard layout
    *   build quality, weight
    *   ethernet port
    *   display size
    *   web cam positioning
    *   price (in my configuration 1.256€ brutto)
    *   available in Germany

    **Cons**

    *   unknown support for Linux distributions other than Ubuntu / openSuse (I'm interested in Arch)

*   `Purism Librem 13 <https://puri.sm/products/librem-13/>`_

    **Pros**

    *   Good Linux support
    *   deactivated Intel ME
    *   hardware kill switches
    *   support a small company with outstanding ethical goals

    **Cons**

    *   13.3 inch display a bit too small
    *   only 7th generation Intel processors
    *   can't get it to Germany without paying customs duty
    *   price tag

*   `System76 Galago Pro <https://system76.com/laptops/galago>`_

    This laptop seems to be the same Clevo N141WU base model as the `Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3`_.
    I won't buy from abroad (here: US) if I get the same model from a local company.

*   `Manjaro Special Edition Spitfire (Station X) <https://stationx.rocks/products/manjaro-special-edition-spitfire>`_

    This laptop seems to be built on top the same Clevo N141WU base model as the `Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3`_.
    I won't buy from abroad (here: GB) if I get the same model from a local company.
    However I noticed that Arch should basically be working with the Clevo models as Manjaro is also Arch based.

Decision
--------

The most relevant candidates were the Lenovo T480 and the `Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3`_.
I chose Tuxedo mainly because I did not want to pay 600€ more for the Lenovo brand.
After all, I don't regret my decision.

Prior buying I contacted the Tuxedo support because I had some open questions that I could not find anything about
online:

*   Is RAM dual channel mode possible?

    -> yes, if two RAM modules are chosen in the configuration (2x8GB or 2x16GB)

*   Are there any working USB-C / Thunderbolt docking stations on the market?

    -> `this <https://www.amazon.de/Notebooks-2048x1152-Audioausgang-Mikrophoneingang-Ultrabook/dp/B00KMNY2Z4>`_
    model should work with DisplayLink drivers (I don't own the docking station yet)

*   Is charging through USB-C possible?

    -> no

*   Are the Tuxedo scripts adaptable to other distributions (especially Arch based)?

    -> no information, they don't test whether other distros work but they claim to be interested in any tests

*   Which web cam model is used?

    -> 1.0M HD video camera USB2.0 – Hersteller Chicony – Treiber-Version 10.0.17134.1

Tuxedo answered within one day in all cases. The support was always friendly and tried hard to convince me.
They even offered the option to send back the device if I'm not satisfied (although I'm a business customer).

Review
------

The review was done running Arch Linux with the Xfce desktop. Only for the battery tests I installed other distros.

Package
^^^^^^^

The laptop arrived in my office only 4 working day after the order.
The package contained

*   the laptop
*   2 chargers (I ordered one extra)
*   a driver CD
*   a rescue USB stick
*   some merchandising articles

    *   pens
    *   two big Linux penguin posters with some basic bash commands - they were squeezed into the box and got a bit
        crumpled
    *   an Ubuntu neckstrap

Build quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My general impression is quite positive. The aluminium body looks and feels great. I have no problems with fingerprints
on the panel top like with the Lenovo.

The display outer surface is made of aluminium, the inner surface (borders around the display) are made of plastic.

Speed
^^^^^

There is nothing to write about the performance. It's outstanding.
However I did not specifically run any benchmarks.
When running ``dmesg`` I see throttling events caused by high temperatures from time to time:

.. code-block:: text

    CPU6: Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 1293)
    CPU2: Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 1293)
    CPU2: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU6: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU0: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU1: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU5: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU4: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU7: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU3: Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 5027)
    CPU6: Core temperature/speed normal
    CPU2: Core temperature/speed normal
    CPU6: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU2: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU0: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU3: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU4: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU7: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU1: Package temperature/speed normal
    CPU5: Package temperature/speed normal

I can't state what the influence on speed is. The fan does not run faster in these scenarios.
Currently it's high summer so the environment temperature is between 25°C and 30°C.

Display
^^^^^^^

*   It's very clear and sharp.
*   The maximum brightness is more than enough for my use cases.
*   There are only minor brightness differences in the corners.
*   The display is nonreflecting which I like.
*   The viewing angle is really good.
*   The display can be opened to 135° (which could be more).

A negative point is that the display cannot be opened with one hand because then the whole laptop moves.

Output of ls* commands

Keyboard
^^^^^^^^

The keyboard is a dream. Short and hard key strokes, all keys are easily reachable and the key size is well chosen.
The big arrow keys are very welcome compared to my old Lenovo device. As a Vim user, I don't need the arrow keys
all the time (hjkl style) but a lot of applications don't feature Vim keymaps.
The super key has a nifty little penguin symbol.
The keyboard backlight can be changed in 6 steps (off + 5 steps) using Fn+F4.
That works out of the box in all tested distributions.

Webcam
^^^^^^

I tested the webcam in `Cheese <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Cheese>`_ and `Riot <https://about.riot.im/>`_ (the Matrix
chat client). I had no problems, my video stream looks good on my side on also for my colleagues.

Here's a screenshot of the test results at https://webcamtests.com:

.. image:: webcamtests_com.png

Arch Linux
^^^^^^^^^^

Tuxedo encourages users to install other Linux distributions too. For Debian based distributions (like all the Ubuntu
derivatives) they provide a `bash install script <http://tuxedo.sh>`_ to make
every aspect of the Laptop work. For Arch there is no such script so I really hoped that most functions work
out-of-the-box. And actually that's the case.

I installed Arch+Xfce with an LVM on LUKS setup and use systemd-boot as bootloader.

Function keys
"""""""""""""

These are the keys that - pressed with ``Fn`` - provide special functions:

=== ================================    ======
key function                            status
=== ================================    ======
°/^ play/pause                          works
F1  touchpad on/off                     does not work
F2  LCD off                             works
F3  mute                                works
F4  keyboard background illumination    works
F5  lower audio volume                  works
F6  increase audio volume               works
F7  open display configuration          works
F8  screen brightness down              works
F9  screen brightness up                works
F10 start camera?                       ?
F11 flight mode                         does not work
F12 sleep mode                          works
Num activate number block               works
=== ================================    ======

Fn+F1 does not work and is not recognized when running
`xev <https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xorg-xev/>`_.

Fn+F11 does not work but the key combo is recognized as ``XF86RFKill`` by ``xev``.
Assigning a small script that switches the hardware modules should be possible.

Brightness control
""""""""""""""""""

With the preinstalled Tuxedo versions of Ubuntu I had no problems changing the screen brightness.
The brightness steps are reasonable and on the lowest level, the screen does not switch completely off.

On Arch+Xfce the brightness steps were too big and on the lowest level the screen switches completely off which I find
undesirable. The brightness is controlled by the Xfce Power Manager. I actually like Power Manager handling it
because it features a nice pop-up notification showing the current brightness (in contrast to e.g.
`xbacklight <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight>`_ which I also tried successfully).
To get smaller brightness steps I compiled power manager `on my own <https://superuser.com/a/1346106/930490>`_.

This brings 2 new configuration options:

*   Brightness step count
*   Exponential flag

The exponential flag brings the advantage of having many small steps at low brightness levels.

I set it like this:

.. image:: power_manager.png

The display still switches completely off after the lowest level is reached but I can live with that.

Hibernate
"""""""""

Read the `arch wiki article <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate>`_ for an
overview to suspend/hibernate on Arch.

Hibernate did not work in the first place because of my partitioning and encryption setup.
The hibernate started and the laptop switched off. After waking up, it was like it was completely restarted.

I encrypted my Arch system using
`LVM on LUKS <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS>`_.

I also switched the bootloader from Grub to `systemd-boot <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot>`_.
What I missed was the ``resume`` hook in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf. It now looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block keyboard keymap encrypt lvm2 resume filesystems fsck)

My systemd-boot configuration looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    $ cat /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
    title Arch Linux
    linux /vmlinuz-linux
    initrd /initramfs-linux.img
    options cryptdevice=UUID=381c18d1-f2ab-411c-906b-5fd354546853:lvm:allow-discards resume=/dev/mapper/vg-swap root=/dev/mapper/vg-root rw pci=nomsi

That means I have a dedicated swap partition which systemd-boot needs as a resume target.
I have 16GB RAM installed and my swap partition has a size of 8GB which is enough to get hibernate working.

Suspend
"""""""

Suspend to ram works perfectly out-of-the-box. The startup time with 2 external displays connected is 4 seconds until
the login screen is visible and all screens are active.

External displays
"""""""""""""""""

I want to connect 2 external displays which works perfectly.
Both displays only feature HDMI input (no display port).

HDMI worked out of the box, but it took me a while to get the second display working using
`this USB-C to HDMI <https://www.amazon.de/Thunderbolt-MacBook-Samsung-Surface-Pixelbook-Raum-grau/dp/B075V5JK36/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1535613009&sr=8-8&keywords=usb+c+hdmi>`_
adapter. I chose an USB-C to HDMI solution because they feature resolutions up to 4K@60Hz which Mini DisplayPort to
HDMI adapters don't.

When first connecting, the display did not show anything. I asked the Tuxedo support and after one day they told me
I had to switch the Display Port interface in BIOS from the display port connector to the USB-C/Thunderbolt port.
It works perfectly now.

Even with 2 external displays connected, the laptop screen is still switched on so that I have 3 displays now.
My former Lenovo E420s could only address a maximum of 2 displays at a time (which might stem from its age).

Fan
^^^

Without load, the fan does not start.
During the day the fan starts from time to time on low speed. Personally I don't find it disturbing.
This is what I do during my work day:

*   some terminal windows open
*   Jetbrains PyCharm IDE running
*   running youtube videos on Firefox
*   VLC for web radio streaming
*   Evolution mail client running in the background
*   Riot chat application running

Currently it's about 23°C room temperature here.
When the room temperature rose above 30° the fan started more often with higher speeds.

If I run the ``stress -c 8`` command to produce load on all 8 logical cores, the fan increases its speed after 40
seconds. After 80 seconds it's on max speed.
After removing the load it takes 60 seconds until the fan starts going slower and after 240 seconds it's amost
unhearable again. 4 minutes are quite a long time and I wonder if that can be tweaked somehow.

I must say I experienced problems with the fan going from off to running state.
2 or 3 times it could not start and just produced an annoyingly high-pitched sound. In these situations I started
``stress`` until the fan started and the problem disappeared. Apparently the fan control has start-up problems when
requesting small fan speeds.

Battery
^^^^^^^

I tested the battery time for various Linux distributions.
The test conditions:

*   Max screen brightness
*   Keyboard illuminated on max level
*   No programs open except 2 small terminal windows to write the battery level to a file and show the file contents
    in the other window.
*   No load
*   Wifi on, but not connected
*   No other peripherals connected

I used this script to write the battery level:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh
    DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S)
    STATE=$(upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | awk '/state/ {print $2}')
    PERCENTAGE=$(upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | awk '/percentage/ {print $2}')
    TTE=$(upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | awk '/time to empty/ {print $4}')
    TTE_UNIT=$(upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | awk '/time to empty/ {print $5}')
    TTF=$(upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | awk '/time to full/ {print $4}')
    TTF_UNIT=$(upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | awk '/time to full/ {print $5}')
    echo "$DATE $STATE $PERCENTAGE $TTE $TTE_UNIT $TTF $TTF_UNIT" >> battery_status.log

These are the battery discharge/charge times:

.. image:: discharge_charge.png

The data source can be downloaded :download:`here <discharge_charge.ods>`.

The laptops runs for 5 hours on max brightness without load and wifi on.
The battery runtime is equal for the preinstalled Tuxedo Budgie on kernel 4.15 as well as for the Arch based
distributions on kernel 4.17. Antergos and Arch did have the  `TLP <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP>`_ package
installed without any further configuration.
Tuxedo preinstalls the Ubuntu `laptop-mode-tools <https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/laptop-mode-tools/>`_ package for energy
management. Apparently this not differ from TLP in terms of battery runtime - at least in my test.

The charge time from 8% to 98% with the 40W charger is almost 3 hours.
The charge and discharge curves are almost linear.

From my point of view the battery life is good. I assume the display on max brightness eats most of the battery life.
When taking the laptop with me I commonly reduce the screen brightness so 7 hours should also be possible.

These are the values that Tuxedo got from Notebookcheck:

.. code-block:: text

    Idle (ohne WLAN, min Helligkeit): 13h 19min
    Surfen über WLAN v1.3: 7h 28min
    Last (volle Helligkeit): 3h 00min

Summary
-------

I really like my new laptop as everything works like a charm now.
The fan management can still be improved in terms regarding speed reduction after removing loads and the start-up
problem. This however does not make me spend 600€ more for a 'brand' model which may also have other problems.

Tuxedo as a company was helpful in all topics and deliverey quickly.
This is what I want when buying from companies that are not widely known.

If you've got any questions, please tell me in the comments section below.
