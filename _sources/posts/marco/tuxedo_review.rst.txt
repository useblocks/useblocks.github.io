Review TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 14 v3 (2018)
===========================================

.. _Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3: https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/10-14-Zoll/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-14-matt-Full-HD-IPS-Aluminiumgehaeuse-bis-Intel-Core-i7-Quad-Core-bis-32GB-RAM-bis-zwei-HDD/SSD-bis-12h-Akku-USB-C-Thunderbolt-3.tuxedo

This blog post is in English despite all previous posts being in German. I just assume a lot international folks might
be interested in this review too. I myself am located in Munich, Germany.

As the title states, I'm going to review the
`Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 v3 <https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/10-14-Zoll/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-14-matt-Full-HD-IPS-Aluminiumgehaeuse-bis-Intel-Core-i7-Quad-Core-bis-32GB-RAM-bis-zwei-HDD/SSD-bis-12h-Akku-USB-C-Thunderbolt-3.tuxedo>`_
which from my perspective plays in the league of a Dell XPS 13/15 or Lenovo T480 when it comes to Linux laptops in the
year 2018.

Tuxedo is a German company, based in KÃ¶nigsbrunn near Augsburg. The company mainly offers Linux compatible PCs and
laptops.

Background
----------

I'm a SW developer on Linux platforms since years. My former Laptop was a Lenovo E420s which came into the years
in terms of battery life, CPU performance, RAM size and performance and portability (weight, size).

So I was looking for a new Linux compatible laptop with state-of-the-art hardware.
The wish list items in order of priority were:

1.  **CPU** 8th generation Intel CPU (Core i5 8xxx, Core i7 8xxx)
#.  **RAM** at least 16GB
#.  **Linux** tested compatibility on Linux
#.  **Display** 14 inch
#.  **Weight** <1.8kg
#.  **Build quality** should be reasonable
#.  **Ethernet** RJ45 Gigabit without adapter
#.  **Web cam** with a reasonable positioning
#.  **Keyboard** German layout
#.  **Keyboard** backlight available
#.  **Keyboard** typing must be fun (I like hard and short key strokes)
#.  **Quiet** CPU fan / silent without load
#.  **Intel ME** option to disable the Intel ME and generally speaking, I like open hardware

Some notes on above items with the numbers referring to above list:

1.  The 8th generation Intel CPUs (model name Kaby Lake Refresh) for mobile devices feature 4 physical cores.
    With hyperthreading the system has 8 logical cores available. This is a huge benefit when running virtual machines
    and doing CPU intensive stuff in the background.
#.  A laptop with less than 16GB of RAM does not make sense these days.
    Any laptop gets a bonus if RAM can be expanded up to 32GB. I don't buy laptops often
    (the Lenovo E420s is from 2011), so upgradeability is master.
#.  The Linux compatibility is a major problem. It's not easy to find information concerning new laptops if they are not
    offered with a Linux distribution preinstalled by the vendor (like the Dell XPS Developer Edition).
    Thinkpads are also known to work well in Linux environments.

    Another point of interest is the definition of 'Linux compatible'. A laptop contains a lot hardware of which may be
    fully compatible, partly compatible or not-at-all compatible. At a minimum, I expect:

    *   Display works with brightness control
    *   Battery life is higher than 5 hours on a recent Linux kernel (4.15 to 4.17) under 'normal' circumstances
        (development, presentation). Problems may arise with CPUs not going into deep idle states or wake-up events
        being continuously fired. This may also involve peripheral.
    *   Touchpad works with multi touch gestures (2-finger scrolling and emulated right/middle mouse buttons clicks).
    *   No restriction to a specific distribution as I will install any distribution I like. Currently I'm on
        Xubuntu (Ubuntu + Xfce) but I want to test Arch + Xfce. The videos of `this <http://unicks.eu>`_ German guy
        convinced me that Arch is the next logical step after running Ubuntu or other Debian based distributions.
        Thanks Nick for your great videos.

        A great source for Linux laptop compatibility is the Arch wiki (in which my Tuxedo laptop is still missing).

    Nice to have are:

    *   Special keys work out of the box
    *   SD card reader
    *   LED indicators

#.  13.3 inch displays are too small for mobile development from my POV and larger displays lack portability.
#.  The weight is relevant although almost all current business laptops of 14 inch display size reach my constraint.
#.  I like Aluminium not plastic and warp resistant laptop bodies and displays.
#.  Having an real ethernet port without bringing an adapter is just nice.
#.  Many vendors build the web cam below the display or even into the keyboard. This is not a user friendly design
    decision. I use video chat throughout my day and colleagues don't want to look at me through the eyes of a fish...
#.  I like a Germany keyboard layout because I live in Germany. It's not an absolute must because I can use a German
    keymap without having the right symbols printed on the keys but it's a plus if I can get it.
#.  Having a background light for the keyboard is a benefit when working in dark environments like during the night or
    also on low-light environments during the day.
#.  This is low on my priority list because most of the time I have an external keyboard attached. But SW development
    is a keyboard centric task so a good keyboard is a plus.
#.  When not running CPU intensive tasks, I don't want the CPU fan to run. If the fan runs, I want the noise to be
    'acceptable'.
#.  I use a lot of open source software, I participate in open source development, I like the Free Software Foundation
    and the the Linux project in general. And open source has a high relevance for companies too (think of Linux or
    OpenStack). Unfortunately, there are no vendors on the market that feature open hardware. The whole industry of
    current desktop computing is build around Intel, AMD or SoCs that have no open specification. That's a pity.
    If I'm going for current hardware, I cannot follow the hardware proposals of the FSF and choose 5 years old hardware.
    Then I could also stick with my old Lenovo.
    Having the option to run Coreboot and remove/deactivate the Intel ME and AMD PSP would really be a huge benefit
    for me.

    There are companies like `Purism <https://puri.sm>` or `system76 <https://system76.com>` that intend to deactivate
    the Intel ME on current CPUs. They do a good job but they will also be a lot behind the current hardware.
    I'd love to live in a world of open hardware, open firmware and companies that will fail when bringing non-open
    hardware to the market. But the truth is, I need an affordable and current product to run the applications I like.

    At the end, there is no product on the market that fulfills the priority items on my wish list, so I had to move
    this point to the end :(

I am not particularly interested in USB-C, Thunderbolt or docking stations. However, if these work with the model of my
choice I'm happy too. Also USB-C charging is nice to have. As I don't have any USB-C hardware or chargers already, I
need a new charger anyway.
