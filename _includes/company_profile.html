            communication, and software solutions.

            100% of our employees are engineers, and we try to contribute to Open-Source projects
            as much as possible. We create bug reports, analyze toolchain stacks, maintain projects and participate
            in conferences.
            We support our employees to create their own digital footprint in the Open-Source world and to become
            a brand outside each company's borders.

            The headquarter of useblocks is located in Munich, but we have employees and freelancers all over Europe.
            And also the teams of our customers are normally distributed all over the world.
            So we support 100% remote work, from everywhere and with working hours at any time.
